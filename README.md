Implement functions to add new items, check out and return items, calculate overdue fines, and search for items.
Develop a user interface for librarians and users to interact with the system.
Test the system thoroughly to ensure accurate data management and smooth operation.

Technologies Used
Python programming language for developing the core functionality.
SQLite database for storing and managing library data.
Tkinter library for creating a graphical user interface (GUI).

Key Insights
Efficient data management is crucial for maintaining accurate records and providing reliable information to users.
User-friendly interface is essential for librarians and users to interact with the system seamlessly.
Error handling and input validation are necessary to ensure data integrity and prevent unexpected behavior.
Regular backups of the database are recommended to safeguard against data loss in case of system failures or errors.
